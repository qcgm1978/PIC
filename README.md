@youthoverturn: @KendoUI performance , interface of machine, compatibility are the bottleneck of #HTML5 I think

best-first principle : at first, let us meet the best browser of the best device by the best method, and graceful degradation.

test-related: according to testing, select the degradation range.

first: the future browser which contains all implemented and not implemented feature

second: the ideal browser contains all implemented by all kinds of real browsers

third: the best real browser e.g. the newest canary browser

forth: the other better browsers 

fifth: the browsers that is tested to find bugs

sixth: the browsers not tested but to generate bugs perhaps 

seventh: the browsers you'd better be compatible to

eighth: browser out of your service
